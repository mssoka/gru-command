# Review-input handoff — operator runbook

Owner ruling j-969. Three review inputs travel one supported handoff into a
frozen Perkins round: **private evidence attachments**, the **exact-target CI
receipt**, and **approved canonical amendments**. This document is the operator
runbook; it describes the shipped mechanism only. Nothing here activates any
live PR or edits historical rounds.

## 1. Private evidence attachments

1. Materialize the private material through the existing attach flow (0700
   uploads dir, bounded media):

   ```
   POST /api/attach/uploads
   Authorization: Bearer <pairing token>
   { "filename": "reference.png", "content_base64": "<base64>" }
   ```

   The response's `path` is the service-managed upload identity. Uploads are
   never copied into git, a review tree, PR comments, or logs.

2. Arm a review naming that identity (at most 4 attachments; PNG/JPEG/GIF/WebP
   only; 8 MiB per file, 16 MiB total):

   ```
   POST /api/dispatch/review
   Authorization: Bearer <pairing token>
   {
     "job_id": "...",
     "evidence": [{
       "upload_path": "<the uploads-dir path>",
       "purpose": "what this material is — say so if it predates the reviewed revision",
       "consent_ref": "<durable consent/approval reference>",
       "captured_at": "YYYY-MM-DD"
     }]
   }
   ```

3. At freeze the bytes are read once, magic-byte validated, hashed and copied
   to `<data_dir>/reviews/<round>/evidence/` with a private `receipt.json`.
   The frozen manifest records the attachment metadata. Review prompts receive
   the pixels through the capability-checked image transport; blind lenses
   receive neither text nor pixels.

**Fail-closed behavior.** Missing/empty/oversized/wrong-type material,
traversal, symlinks, foreign paths, non-upload names, mutated frozen bytes, or
a text-only review model all refuse loudly. A refusal is never replaced by a
written description, and the round/turn does not pretend the evidence was
delivered.

**Honesty rule.** A purpose label must not claim the image was rendered at the
reviewed SHA when it was not. Reference material may predate the revision; the
frozen receipt includes capture time so readers can tell.

## 2. Exact-target CI evidence

No operator action is required. The GitHub poll records
`github.ci-green` / `github.ci-failed` / `github.branch-state` for tracked
lanes; at freeze the host binds the latest observation to the exact
repository/PR/SHA and renders it into the frozen spec context (beside, and
distinct from, the local scheduler verification block) and into the manifest.

- GREEN/PENDING/FAILED render the recorded state with check names/URLs,
  observation time and source event (kind + seq).
- A stale SHA, wrong repository/PR, malformed payload, or absent observation
  renders an explicit `UNAVAILABLE` / `NOT-MATCHED` limitation — never a PASS
  and never a fabricated failure.
- Frozen rounds stay historically stable; late results do not rewrite them.

## 3. Approved canonical amendments

Amendments are append-only and versioned. The original briefing is never
rewritten; later rounds render the effective acceptance, earlier rounds keep
their frozen record.

Read the current contract (version, both hashes, full effective text):

```
GET /api/dispatch/jobs/<job_id>/contract
Authorization: Bearer <pairing token>
```

Append an approved amendment:

```
POST /api/dispatch/amendment
Authorization: Bearer <pairing token>
{
  "job_id": "...",
  "body": "the accepted amendment text",
  "supersedes": ["original:Acceptance 1", "amendment:<id>"],
  "approval": { "by": "owner", "reference": "epoch12 seq194760 client_msg_id ..." },
  "expected_contract_sha256": "<the hash you just read>",
  "idempotency_key": "<optional retry key>"
}
```

- `expected_contract_sha256` is optimistic concurrency: a stale or concurrent
  writer is refused (`409`) with the current hash/version and the refusal is
  audited (`job.amendment-rejected`).
- The same `idempotency_key` + same request retries deterministically; a key
  reused for a different request conflicts.
- Each acceptance is audited (`job.amendment-accepted`) with amendment id,
  version, body hash, approval provenance and contract hashes.
- 400 for malformed/improperly-authorized requests (a blank or missing
  approval reference is refused); terminal jobs and jobs without a recorded
  briefing take no amendments.

**Authorization honesty.** The service's paired bearer token is the only
authentication primitive. `approval.by`/`reference` are recorded provenance,
not an identity system — never accept an amendment whose reference does not
resolve to a real owner decision, and never treat a repository document or a
worker/caller-declared role as approval.

## 4. What freeze binds (audit trail)

Every frozen round records:

- `manifest.acceptance`: contract version, base/effective hashes, amendment ids.
- `manifest.reviewEvidence`: frozen attachment metadata and the CI record.
- A `round.review-inputs-frozen` ledger event with the same hashes/provenance
  (no pixels, no upload paths).

## 5. Activating a previously blocked PR (owner-controlled, later)

This lane ships the mechanism only. When the owner chooses to supply evidence
or amendments to an existing PR:

1. Re-check the live head, ownership and gates first — historical reviewed
   heads are not clearance.
2. Materialize the evidence upload, read the current contract hash, then arm a
   **new** review round (never edit old manifests/specs/verdicts). The new
   round freezes the effective acceptance and evidence; old rounds are
   untouched.
3. For PR165-style renamed-skill corrections, append the approved amendment
   with its real provenance reference, then freeze a new round.
4. Existing pending source/control records are never replaced; re-arm only
   through the supported endpoints above. Merges, restarts and deployments
   stay owner-held.
